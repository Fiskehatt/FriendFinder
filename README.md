# FriendFinder

An addon that helps you find your old friends from other servers!

The addon tries to add your old friends to your friends list. 
This makes it easy to check if any of your old pals are playing on the same server :)

Slash command: "/friendfinder"


WARNING: The addon may add a lot of people to your friends list.

Note: You must add your friends to FriendFinder.lua for the addon to work.
